VenueCorp
=========

A Web-App that combines all events happening around austria.
This App is designed to be used by organisations and unions that have an interest in 
customize their own events around certain regions and present them on web.

Nevertheless if you want to start this app locally or on a server you just need to install image-magick for paperclip
and you must alter the action-mailer settings in the config-Folder.
